This directory contains a problem that uses proteomics data as input.

The raw file with all samples is `input_for_proteomics2.csv`, the following case studies are of interest:

 Create inputs for the following cases:
   1.   P3_00 (up) vs. WT_00 (down)
   2.   WT_00 (up) vs. WT_400 (down)
   2.   P3_00 (up) vs. P3_400 (down)
12h = time point 1
16h = time point 2
Header labels:  Strain_[thiamine concentration]_time_replicate

Since this proteomics data has already been processed flooring and log transformation is not performed (this is indicated in param.csv)
